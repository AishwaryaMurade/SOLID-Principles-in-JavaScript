### The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that help developers write clean, maintainable, and flexible code.

Here's a simple explanation of one of the SOLID principles, the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), in the context of JavaScript:

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. In other words, it should have a single responsibility or purpose.

Here's a brief explanation of each principle:

### [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](https://github.com/AishwaryaMurade/SOLID-Principles-in-JavaScript/tree/main/Single_Responsibility_Principle):
Each class or function should have only one responsibility or job. It means that a module should focus on doing one thing well and not try to handle multiple unrelated tasks.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities (classes, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. It encourages writing code in a way that allows adding new functionality without changing the existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. In simpler terms, if a program works with a certain type, it should work with any of its subtypes without causing unexpected behavior.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle emphasizes that classes or modules should not have dependencies on interfaces they don't need, and interfaces should be tailored to the specific needs of clients.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. It promotes decoupling of modules by introducing abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) to depend on, rather than relying on specific implementations.

### By following these principles, developers can create code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend. They help in achieving modularity, reusability, and reducing the impact of changes in one part of the codebase on other parts.
