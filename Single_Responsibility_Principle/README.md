# The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in JavaScript states that a class or function should have only one responsibility or job. It means that each module should focus on doing one thing well and not try to handle multiple unrelated tasks.

Here's a simple example to illustrate SRP in JavaScript:

Let's say we have a Calculator class that performs calculations and also handles file operations, such as reading and writing data to a file. However, this violates the SRP because it has two responsibilities.

```javascript
class Calculator {
  constructor() {
    // ...
  }

  add(a, b) {
    // Perform addition calculation
  }

  multiply(a, b) {
    // Perform multiplication calculation
  }

  saveToFile(data) {
    // Write data to a file
  }

  loadFromFile() {
    // Read data from a file
  }
}
```
To adhere to the SRP, we would separate these responsibilities into two different classes:

```javascript
class Calculator {
  constructor() {
    // ...
  }

  add(a, b) {
    // Perform addition calculation
  }

  multiply(a, b) {
    // Perform multiplication calculation
  }
}

class FileHandler {
  constructor() {
    // ...
  }

  saveToFile(data) {
    // Write data to a file
  }

  loadFromFile() {
    // Read data from a file
  }
}

```

By separating the responsibilities, the Calculator class focuses solely on performing calculations, while the FileHandler class handles the file-related operations. This adheres to the SRP, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

Separating concerns in this way allows each class to have a clear and single responsibility, making it easier to modify, test, and reuse the code in the future.
